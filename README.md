In this project I have priced the American Options using the Black Scholes formula and the Monte-Carlo Simulations.

The focus of this project would be to compare the Numerical values obtained with the actual values in the market for the stock indices. Options are financial instruments that play an important role in the finance industry, they are mainly used in the hedging, speculation and arbitraging. There has been always a need to value these options as they are widely used in investing. Options were considered as an obscure financial instrument due to the lack of valuation techniques in the past. This obscurity was broken when Black â€“ Scholes devised a model in 1973 which could value these options and this escalated the options trading. In this project the sample market prices of the market will be considered for the valuation. The method that is will used widely in the project would be the Monte Carlo Simulation techniques. So, the valuation of the option would be done using the Black-Scholes formula with the help of the Monte Carlo simulation.


The proposed approach, applied in Monte Carlo simulation, is based on the Black-Scholes equation which generally defined the pricing of European call options in a dynamic environment. Therefore, the main goal of this study is how can Monte Carlo and the variance reduction technique be applied to finance?
